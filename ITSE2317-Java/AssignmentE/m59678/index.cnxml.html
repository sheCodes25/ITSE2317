FlowLayout arranges components left to right until no more components fit on the same line. When no more components will fit on a line, a new line is started below the current line. Each line of components can either be centered, left aligned, or right aligned in the container.
If the container is resized by the user at runtime, the locations of the components will be automatically adjusted to place the maximum possible number of components on the first and each successive line.</div>

<p id="p1000">
Over the years, I have published a large number of tutorials in the areas of computer programming and 
	digital signal processing (DSP). As I have time available, I am converting the more significant of those tutorials into cnxml code and re-publishing them at 
	

<a href="http://cnx.org/" id="a1003">

cnx.org

</a>

.



</p>




<p id="p1001">
In the meantime, this is one of the pages in a book titled
	

	

<a href="http://cnx.org/contents/-2RmHFs_:JVTd7bX1" id="a1004">

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java

</a>

 
that presents PDF versions of the original tutorials to make them readily available for Connexions users. 
When I have time available, I plan to update this tutorial and to re-publish it 
as a standard page at 

<a href="http://cnx.org/" id="a1005">

cnx.org

</a>

.

</p>




<p id="p1002">
This tutorial may contain internal links to other tutorials that I have 
written and published somewhere on the web. Those links may, or may not still be 
good. In any event, if you search 

<a href="http://cnx.org/" id="a1006">

cnx.org

</a>

 for the 
tutorial by title or by topic, you will probably find a clean copy of the 
referenced tutorial at 

<a href="http://cnx.org/" id="a1007">

cnx.org

</a>

. If not, you can probably use a


<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search" id="a1008">

 to find a 
copy somewhere on the web.
